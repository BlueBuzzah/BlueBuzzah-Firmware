## Abstract

Enhanced neuronal synchronization of the subthalamic nucleus represents a hallmark finding in PD patients associated with motor decline. Coordinated reset therapy was developed to decouple synchronized neural states. This protocol describes a non-invasive vibrotactile coordinated reset (vCR) intervention delivering gentle vibrations to fingertips.

Study 1 comprises a 7-month double-blind sham-controlled investigation with 30 PD participants randomly assigned to active or sham vCR. Participants receive four hours daily stimulation across two-hour blocks for six months, followed by one month without stimulation. Primary outcome measures the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III off medication after six months.

Study 2 examines dosing effects using remote monitoring. Previous vCR research demonstrated sustained motor improvements and reduced medication requirements. This protocol will establish clinical efficacy and support FDA clearance of the investigational vibrotactile device.

## Introduction

Over six million individuals worldwide experience Parkinson's Disease, representing the second most prevalent neurodegenerative condition. While dopaminergic medications remain the treatment standard, disease progression necessitates escalating doses, and medication-related adverse effects including dyskinesia and psychosis limit long-term utility. Deep brain stimulation offers effectiveness but carries surgical risks and may worsen certain symptoms including speech impairment.

Prior computational and animal research established that coordinated reset stimulation can induce sustained desynchronization of pathologically synchronized neural networks. Earlier human investigations with vibrotactile coordinated reset demonstrated improvements in gait and motor function during and following treatment intervals. Building upon these findings, this expanded protocol evaluates vCR across larger sample sizes and broader symptom domains.

## Methods and Analysis

### Vibrotactile Coordinated Reset Therapy

The vCR stimulation pattern employs periodic vibratory bursts delivered with temporal variability uniformly distributed within ±23.5% of inter-stimulus intervals. Each vCR cycle comprises four sequential bursts across fingertips two through five. Sequences randomly vary across cycles using a 3:2 ON-OFF pattern. Bilateral mirrored stimulation activates corresponding right and left fingers simultaneously at 250 Hz with 100-millisecond burst duration. CR frequency equals 1.5 Hz with 667-millisecond cycle length. Individual sessions last two hours.

### Vibrotactile Device Description

The investigational wearable system consists of a battery-operated controller with wire-connected vibrotactile stimulators attached via custom glove. Elastic Velcro bands secure tactors to fingertips. An organic light-emitting diode screen displays battery status and remaining session duration. The device logs therapy sessions for compliance verification and charges via micro-USB.

### Patient Population

Eligible participants present with idiopathic Parkinson's disease at Hoehn and Yahr stages II-IV while medicated. Inclusion requires age 45-85 and minimum 30% MDS-UPDRS III improvement on versus off medication. Study enrollment limits to San Francisco Bay area residents.

### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Exclusion criteria encompass dopamine dysregulation syndrome, concurrent neurological disorders, psychoactive medication use, anticonvulsants, ADHD or mood medications affecting EEG activity, current participation in other trials, pregnancy, and severe fingertip sensory abnormalities.

### Pre-assessment Measures

Potential participants complete health questionnaires and undergo neurological evaluation by movement disorders specialists. Dopaminergic medication responsiveness assessment utilizes the MDS-UPDRS III administered off medication, followed by carbidopa-levodopa administration and reassessment. Cognitive screening employs the Mini Mental State Examination and Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease-Cognition to exclude dementia. Vibratory sensory discrimination testing identifies participants with severe abnormalities.

### Study Personnel and Roles

The protocol incorporates five blinded movement disorders neurologists. One serves as treating clinician providing medical guidance and adverse event contact. Another administers primary MDS-UPDRS assessments throughout both studies. Three additional specialists rate video-recorded motor assessments. Clinical research coordinators oversee consent, objective measurements, EEG recordings, and questionnaires. A speech disorders specialist analyzes voice samples. An unaffiliated statistician performs blinded analyses.

## Study 1: Double-Blind Sham-Controlled Phase

### Design

A 7-month double-blind investigation randomly assigns 30 PD participants to active vCR (n=15) or sham stimulation (n=15). Participants receive four hours daily stimulation for six months, followed by one-month stimulation cessation to assess sustained effects.

### Assessments: Study 1

**Primary outcome:** MDS-UPDRS part III off medication at six months

**Secondary outcomes include:**
- MDS-UPDRS parts IA, IB, II, IV
- Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire-39
- Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale-2
- University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test
- Freezing of gait questionnaire
- Vibratory temporal discrimination task
- Speech and voice assessments (acoustic measures, intelligibility, perceptual ratings)
- Electroencephalography recordings (sensorimotor task, vibration-evoked potentials, resting state)
- Objective motor measurements via wearable accelerometry
- Gait disturbance assessment
- Medication requirements
- Device usability and tolerability questionnaire

### Visit Procedures: Study 1

Baseline visits occur at weeks 0, 12, 24, and 28. Participants arrive off medication to undergo physical examination, MDS-UPDRS III (video-recorded), EEG recording, vibratory discrimination testing, and speech assessment. Following carbidopa-levodopa administration and one-hour interval, participants repeat motor assessments. Home-based therapy proceeds for two-hour sessions twice daily with minimum one-hour intervals. Weekly usability questionnaires and at-home motor monitoring using wearable devices occur throughout.

### Statistical Analysis: Study 1

A 2 (sham versus active vCR) by 4 (baseline, three, six, and seven months) mixed factorial analysis of variance will separately evaluate outcome measures. An interim analysis at the three-month timepoint (16 participants, eight per group) will recalculate sample size requirements.

## Study 2: Remote Dosing Phase

### Design

Following unblinding at seven months, all participants receive active vCR at reduced dosing (two hours daily maximum to two hours three times weekly minimum) for six additional months with remote monitoring.

### Remote Study Procedures

Participants complete online questionnaires and continue home motor monitoring one to three times weekly. Remote video-based MDS-UPDRS assessments occur at months 10, 13, and 14 (post one-month stimulation pause).

**Primary outcome:** Remote MDS-UPDRS part III off medication

**Secondary outcomes:** Quality of life, sleep, gait, medication requirements, motor assessments

### Statistical Analysis: Study 2

Comparisons between high-dose Study 1 participants and dose-reduced Study 2 participants employ mixed factorial analysis of variance across identical timepoints and measures.

## Medication Withdrawal Procedures

Depending on medication half-life, participants discontinue therapy 12-48 hours before off-medication assessments. Extended-release formulations require 48-hour withdrawal; immediate-release formulations require 12 hours.

---

## Adverse Event Reporting

Previous preclinical investigations documented tolerance with minimal adverse effects. Potential physical discomfort from glove wear requires monitoring. Medication-induced dyskinesia management involves consultation with treating neurologists before dose reduction. Clinical worsening must be reported within ten business days.

## Discussion

### Study 1 Significance

Testing against a dedicated sham condition clarifies vCR's motor benefits and effects across PD subtypes (tremor-dominant, postural instability/gait difficulty, akinetic-rigid). Non-motor evaluations address understudied domains. The olfactory system, uniquely activated through sniffing as a sensorimotor act, may benefit from therapies modulating sensorimotor brain regions. Sleep disturbances frequently accompany PD and potentially improve through enhanced motor function and reduced medication. Speech abnormalities relate to sensorimotor integration deficits; therapies targeting these systems may yield benefits.

The vibratory temporal discrimination task may identify individual sensory differences enabling personalized vCR calibration. Research indicates PD patients exhibit elevated temporal discrimination thresholds compared to healthy controls; dopaminergic therapy partially restores thresholds while subthalamic nucleus stimulation degrades them. vCR may reverse these thresholds through long-lasting synaptic reorganization.

EEG investigations assess sensorimotor integration through multiple measures: desynchronization of sensorimotor rhythm correlates with faster reaction times; readiness potential amplitude reflects supplementary motor area function; contingent negative variation indicates motor preparation capacity.

### Study 2 Significance

Optimal therapeutic outcomes require sufficient treatment adherence. Determining minimal effective dosing reduces daily time commitment and improves compliance. Comparing high-dose six-month outcomes against reduced-dose protocols clarifies necessary stimulation intensity. Previous case observations suggested two hours three times weekly maintained benefits observed with four-hour daily dosing.
